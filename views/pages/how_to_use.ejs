  		Material_Spiritual_Converging: "A word given in Ybigh could be part of a terrible, a wonderful or any experience in between, for you or others. This experience lets the word take on special meaning, and is in the state of material/spiritual converging. Converging means a unity is forming with the word and its connections that turns it into a symbol. The unity (and newly-created symbol) consists in your knowledge of the word and your experiences with it.<br /><br />"+
        "To know whether spiritual-material convergence has happened to you or others, cast your mind back and recall some of your past experiences. While examining their significance, try to remember who and/or what was involved and some of the details.<br />"+
        "You might immediately see a problem with doing this. The fact is, and by the time we\’re 30, have built up literally millions of experiences; and without a catelyst to spur our memories, it’s not always easy to recall them.<br /><br />"+
        "Ybigh is here to help.<br /><br />"+
        "Use the words in Ybigh to jog your memory. Some words may conjure up immediate memories of experiences while others might take some mediating over. Admittedly, the words in Ybigh are pretty general so be creative when connecting them to your experiences.<br /><br />"+
        "Once words from the list are identified, Ybigh gives you the opportunity to weigh the magnitude of the experience in relation to them. Did you choose the word <strong>glove</strong> and are recalling the OJ Simpson trial? Was it the time Led Zeppelin\'s' <strong>music</strong> helped you finish your math homework flawlessly? If you\’re an <strong>Athlete</strong>, perhaps you\’re remembering a time when you were <i>in the zone</i> and able out-run and out-score your competitors with ease. Maybe you\'re a <strong>Chess Player</strong> and could see every move on the board before it was made. <br />How you decide to weigh these individual experiences is up to you. Some of these experiences, like the OJ trial perhaps, may not even be your own. But it still affected you and, by extension, you can imagine how it affected others. Feel free to explore any and all experiences related to you or others.<br /><br />"+
        "Let it be known that these are examples of how the spiritual and material parts of both people and things can converge. Things like <strong>Glove</strong> and <strong>Music</strong> or people like <strong>Athlete</strong> and <strong>Chess Player</strong>. While the above info is plenty to get you started, we offer further learning here.<br /><br />",
  		Spiritual: "Spiritual substance means it has no parts and cannot be separated into parts – it\’s unitary. It can\’t be sensed or detected, but it can be thought of.<br /><strong>Reason</strong>, <strong>Happiness</strong>, <strong>Justice</strong>, <strong>Will</strong>, <strong>Evil</strong> are examples of spiritual things.<br /><br />Consider <strong>Justice</strong> in itself. Not acts or circumstances that are just or lack justice, only the abstract notion of Justice. You can't break off a piece of Justice and make it stand on its own, though you may apply it or remove it from some things to make them just or unjust.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even though spiritual things can be reasoned about, it\'s often very hard to do so. Don't get too hung up wondering if a word is spiritual or not. You can always go back or update your evaluations later if you change your mind.",
        Material: "Material substance is defined as something that has or can be <strong>composed of parts</strong>, each of which is different from the other. Material things can therefore degrade or be perfected. Cars rust, toys break, children are born, grow up, grow old, and so on.<br /><br /><strong>Bacteria</strong>, <strong>baseballs</strong> and <strong>boomerangs</strong> are material things -- they’re all around us.",
        Foundation: "To begin to explain how this works, we’ll start with the idea that everything has a foundation. The foundation is the <strong>existence</strong> and <strong>essence</strong> of everything -- its being. <br /><br />Next comes the question, what sort of being is it?  If it\’s a <strong>substance</strong> of some sort, it is either a spiritual or material substance or it’s a combination of the two. It could also be a modification of the substance, and that\’s called an <strong>\‘accident\’</strong>. <br />'Accident can be the quality of something.",
        Opinion: "While we may not acknowledge it or even realize it, things have layers of meaning; deep meaning in many cases. And by presenting you with an opportunity to express how you feel about these things, will hopefully uncover these dormant layers of meaning within you. <i>You’re more than what your shopping cart says about you</i>.",
