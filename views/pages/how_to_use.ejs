  		Material_Spiritual_Converging: "The words in Ybigh could be part of a terrible, a great, or any experience in between for you or others. This experience causes the word to take on special meaning for you or others. This is the process of spiritual-material converging. Converging means a unity is forming around the word in question that turns it into a symbol. The unity (and newly created symbol) consist of your knowledge of the word and your experiences with it."+  
        "<br /><br /><strong>Personality</strong> is an example of spiritual-material converging. Any living, spiritual being that possesses <strong>intellect</strong> and <strong>will</strong> is what we call a \'person\' and has what we call 'personality'. <strong>Personality</strong> is composed of spiritual parts (<strong>will</strong> and <strong>intellect</strong>) as well as material parts, such as our <strong>5 senses</strong>. The fact that people can do both spiritual and material operations, "+
      "shows that people our \'spiritual-material converging\'. Some people converge more and some less. <strong>Great athletes</strong> often talk about <i>being in the zone</i> where everyone else on the court or field appears to be moving much slower than they are from their perspective. This is an example of how the spiritual and material parts of our personality can converge to give us increased performance.<br /><br />spiritual-material converging can apply to everything including any specific object.<br /><br /> <strong>1)</strong> If you get cut with a <strong>knife</strong> then knives might leave a lasting impression on you. <br /><strong>2)</strong> Things like <strong>noise</strong> or <strong>silence</strong> can converge."+ 
      " We can have great incite or profound feelings when things are noisy or silent. (Both noise and silence are material substances since they involve movement, or non-movement respectively, of air)",
  		Spiritual: "Spiritual substance means it <strong>has no parts</strong> and cannot be separated into parts – it\’s unitary.  It can’t be sensed or detected, but it can be thought of.<br /><strong>Reason</strong>, <strong>Happiness</strong>, <strong>Justice</strong>, <strong>Will</strong>, <strong>Evil</strong> are examples of spiritual things.<br /><br />Consider <strong>Justice</strong> in itself. Not acts or circumstances that are just, only the abstract notion of Justice. You can\'t break off a piece of Justice and make it stand on it\'s own. Arguably, things are either Just or they’re not. There’s no middle ground.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even though spiritual things can be reasoned about, it\'s often very hard to do so. Don't get too hung up thinking about if a word is spiritual or not. You can always go back or update your selections later if you change your mind.",
        Material: "Material substance is defined as something that has or can be <strong>composed"+" of parts</strong>, each of which is different than the other."+ 
          " Material things <strong>can also be degraded</strong> over time or by a person. Cars rust, toys break and so on. <br /><br />Bacteria, baseballs and boomerangs are some other"+ " material things, they\’re all around us.",
        Foundation: "To begin to explain how this works, we’ll start with the idea that everything has a foundation. The foundation is the <strong>existence</strong> and <strong>essence</strong> of everything -- its being. <br /><br />Next comes the question, what sort of being is it?  If it\’s a <strong>substance</strong> of some sort, it is either a spiritual or material substance or it’s a combination of the two. It could also be a modification of the substance, and that\’s called an <strong>\‘accident\’</strong>. <br />'Accident can be the quality of something.",
        Opinion: "While we may not acknowledge it or even realize it, things have layers of meaning; deep meaning in many cases. And by presenting you with an opportunity to express how you feel about these things, will hopefully uncover these dormant layers of meaning within you. <i>You’re more than what your shopping cart says about you</i>.",
